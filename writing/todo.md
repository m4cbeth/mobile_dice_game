# TODO

 - change "swing radius"
	- right now it's just a "distlance less than"
	- should be:
		if x < that ammount, and y < a smaller amount
		This should result in them only kinda swining on sides
	Furthermore:
		Target should be target.global_position.x +/- pxs to front of sprite
		(depending on if it's to it's left or right.')
