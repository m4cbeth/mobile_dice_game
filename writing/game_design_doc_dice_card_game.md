# Mobile Dice Game
That's all it's been called so far. "Invoke" maybe? That's what the button says. And that's the goal.
"Evoke" something lol.

Anyways. here's the stray thought:
	killing the slimes gives hearts (start with 3)
	until screen can't fit, next heart tries to animate into place, then falls.
	hearts pile up
	makes it obvious you don't "need" hearts.

Eventually a wizard or something comes:
	he's been summoning them... sending them to help
	to reinforce and protect? From something else coming?

Maybe slimes die and animate into hearts?


# Dialogue
## Scene: Wizard Finally appears (after X slimes)
"what the hell are you doing?!" dead slime corpses everywhere
hearts fill the whole top of screen, and they're also piling up
"what are you, collecting their hearts? You frickin' psycho! You're nuts!"

But wait. That's a comedy thing. I thought I was going for a serious, psychological thriller
the game is playing you, making you "hack" but by getting you to call commands and attack nodes.
Like... I don't know. Maybe that's dumb. Maybe go with what's easier/more natural? Fucking around
and trying to be funny?
