# Mobile Dice Game
That's all it's been called so far. "Invoke" maybe? That's what the button says. And that's the goal.
"Evoke" something lol.

Anyways. here's the stray thought:
	killing the slimes gives hearts (start with 3)
	until screen can't fit, next heart tries to animate into place, then falls.
	hearts pile up
	makes it obvious you don't "need" hearts.

Eventually a wizard or something comes:
	he's been summoning them... sending them to help
	to reinforce and protect? From something else coming?

Maybe slimes die and animate into hearts?
