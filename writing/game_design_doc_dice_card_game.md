#### Mobile Dice Game ####
(which is slowly just becoming a desktop game)

# Dialogue
Wizard: "they're green lil smiley slimey guys. What's wrong with you?!"
	"what do you need the nice guys to carry signs"
[BUTTON]: MAYBE
/ SOMETHING ELSE. If player clicks the maybe:
	the next wave of green guys carry little white flags

# Gameplay (will player ever need to move whole hand)
Or some thing to grab a lot of mobs? If so I thought of funny dialogue.
Some voice, "need a hand?" tehehehe ala undertale or whatever I'm thinking of
"well, I'll give you a hand. If you need a hand, play a hand"
...
"You need to play a certain nubmer of cards, I'll give you five guesses"
(get it; if you play a hand, you'll get a hand tool maybe? To pick up the whole hand?)

this tutorial is the antithesis of what we're going for.
playing a game for the first time should be a discovery, not a lecture
Gameplay loop of this is, as each wave comes, you don't know what mobs do what:
	what they're hostile towards
	what type of damage they do
	what things are hostile towards them
	special bonuses
So far things we could have:
	slimes,
	knights
	wizards,
	wolves.
Wolves alone are bad? Or eat slimes, knights can be used to defend slimes, but would also attack slimes

Kill x slimes and zthings appear left of invoke
they can damage knights from behind and take agro (because higher damage)
then slimes hit from behind... But zthings only spawn in if...
This is getting dumb.
Because I'm not thinking about how a player will react....
What will a player do?
They will invoke the knights

// hmm, the wizard that shows up later?
	"what did you do?
	
	I'll just wait for my bus.
	Don't worry, I'll leave this barrier down until the bus comes.
	You can use it too or remove it depending if on who comes your way.
		if player removes and knights on field:
			knights attack, if land on Wizard:
				Knight yells "what the fuck"
				becomes hostile, soulstype music
				can only _really_ beat if you've used the slimes
					can speed up if you bring dicedeck to the slimes
					each slime give one option
						either
							upgrade knights
							upgrade dice
							
							once they have x, they get new cards (wolfs).


So far the thought is this:
	Can use cards to block, summon
	Dice deck will eventually deal more.
	They can damage and kill slimes
	Until reveal that slimes were trying to help
	Boss fight begins

Then have to create "second" gameplay loop where:
	you don't let the slimes die. i.e. don't summon knights when they're on field
	can use cards to hurry up slimes
	or drag deck to them.

# Dice Mechanics


Upgrade die...
what is it now? You can pull cards... as long... as you have stamina?
second green bars below hearts... If you pull cards without stamina loose heart
Replace the 6 with a skull, roll skull, loose heart.


Rogue or Assasin type. Seems like a shitty, maybe less that you wouldn't take?
But it doesn't get agrroed by bad guys (i.e. not_add_to or add to their own group and exclude)
and secret ugrade if you keep at least one on your die, it rigs the die so although the random
animation still plays. What ever you clicked on is what it will be.
(This might be dumb)
Still not sure what the main thing with this is gonna be.

## Player hand
if higher than X cards, n-x cards get desstroyed at random
So you might be rolling to try to get one more card, but...
	if you're at say 4 (and that's the num we go with)
	and you roll 3 new cards
	as soon as they land they might burst into flames
	(probally not, probably 3 others)
This needs refinement... but something like this.

# Thoughts

That's all it's been called so far. "Invoke" maybe? That's what the button says. And that's the goal.
"Evoke" something lol.

Anyways. here's the stray thought:
	killing the slimes gives hearts (start with 3)
	until screen can't fit, next heart tries to animate into place, then falls.
	hearts pile up
	makes it obvious you don't "need" hearts.

Eventually a wizard or something comes:
	he's been summoning them... sending them to help
	to reinforce and protect? From something else coming?

Maybe slimes die and animate into hearts?


# Dialogue
## Scene: Wizard Finally appears (after X slimes)
"what the hell are you doing?!" dead slime corpses everywhere
hearts fill the whole top of screen, and they're also piling up
"what are you, collecting their hearts? You frickin' psycho! You're nuts!"

But wait. That's a comedy thing. I thought I was going for a serious, psychological thriller
the game is playing you, making you "hack" but by getting you to call commands and attack nodes.
Like... I don't know. Maybe that's dumb. Maybe go with what's easier/more natural? Fucking around
and trying to be funny?
